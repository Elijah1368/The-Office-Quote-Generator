Office quotes organized to its characters so you can get your daily dose of Jim, Dwight, or Michael whenever you feel like it.

I did not make the images for this app. I borrowed it from here (https://www.pinterest.com/pin/692850723896017932/)

Created with *create-react-app*. See the [full create-react-app guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
